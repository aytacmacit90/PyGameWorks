# PyGameWorks
Its my first pygame work.

Requirements:

* python (installed on system and set system variables)

* pip (for installation of libraries easily)

* pygame



In this project I have tried to create some simple game with only simple logics. 


1- Rabbit character as our main char

2- Fox , wolf and lion as our enemies

3- Enemies fall down from upside of screen and we are trying to move on left or right to not crash them

4- I put simple level logic for now, I will improve that later.

5- I will add intro page in next version.

6- I have few bugs, I will clean them.

7- I have music and crash sound for now. I will add some logic; different enemies, different sounds.
